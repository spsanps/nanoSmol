# =============================================================================
# Ablation A5: Frozen DINO (lr_dino = 0)
# =============================================================================
# Tests whether DINO fine-tuning is needed at all.
#
# Change from baseline:
#   lr_dino: 1e-5 --> 0  (DINO weights completely frozen)
#
# DINO is pretrained with a strong self-supervised objective and already
# produces excellent patch features. The foveated query mechanism sits ON TOP
# of DINO features -- perhaps it can learn to attend to the right patches
# without DINO having to change.
#
# If frozen DINO matches baseline, we save ~22M params of gradient computation
# (~30% memory saving). If it hurts significantly, DINO adaptation to the
# query pathway is important.
#
# This is stronger than LR2 (lr_dino=1e-6): completely zero gradients.
#
# Expected runtime: ~1.5h on 2xA100-80GB (faster -- no DINO backward pass)
