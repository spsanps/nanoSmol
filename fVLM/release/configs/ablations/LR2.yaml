# =============================================================================
# Ablation LR2: 100x LR Ratio (High Connector, Very Low DINO)
# =============================================================================
# connector=1e-4, dino=1e-6, llm=1e-5
# Connector:DINO ratio = 100:1, Connector:LLM ratio = 10:1
#
# Change from baseline:
#   lr_dino: 1e-5  -->  lr_dino: 1e-6
#
# Hypothesis: DINO is well-pretrained for visual feature extraction and may
# not need much adaptation for the foveated query mechanism.  The cross-
# attention query pathway (connector) does most of the "learning to look"
# work.  Keeping DINO nearly frozen could reduce catastrophic forgetting
# of its patch-level representations.
#
# If this matches or beats LR1, DINO fine-tuning is not critical and we
# can save memory by freezing it in later stages.
#
# Expected runtime: ~2h on 2xA100-80GB
