Inspired by [karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and the SmolLM/SmolVLM research threads (huggingface/smollm).

Goal: To experiment quickly with VLMs (Vision+Language Models) in a minimal codebase. Using smolLM, smolVLM, and other models as reference.

Status: More coming soon.
- smolLM implementation (no vision).
